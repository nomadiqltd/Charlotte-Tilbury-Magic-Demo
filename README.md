# Charlotte-Tilbury-Magic-Demo
Overview: 
Below are some snippets of my favourite bits of the Magic app on which I worked on. The videoplayer (using exoplayer), the custom Beauty calendar and integratting Emarsys to enable Push notifications to specific user screens.

Challenges: 
<br>
-> Directing Push notifications to difficult screens nested deep within the navigation hierarchy. 
There were also several bugs within the navigation UI library itself from Android's navigation Library.
</br>

<br>
-> Synchronising the Beauty Calendar with the below news feed. 
Utlising parts of an existing library to work through the incremental date and tieing it together with a Recyclerview
</br>

<br>
-> Leveraging Webviews to maintain seamless UX within various joureys within the app flow where a user might be signed out.
</br>

<br>
-> The users required a different user account per locale e.g. UK, Spain, Germany were all different online stores with their own product inventory and news information,
so we had to find a way to enable the user to shop in a different Store/Locale without requiring further intrusive Android location permissions.
