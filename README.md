# Charlotte-Tilbury-Magic-Demo
Overview: 
Below are some snippets of my favourite bits of the Magic app. The videoplayer (using exoplayer), the custom Beauty calendar and Push notifications to specific user screens.

Challenges: 
Directing Push notifications to difficult screens nested deep within the navigation hieracrhy. 
Synchronising the Beauty Calendar with the feed. 
Leveraging Webviews to maintain a seamless UX experience in various joureys within the app flow.
